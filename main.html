    <h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexicity is understood as the time taken by the program to run and complete the given task. As a programmer your goal should be to reduce the time complexicity of the code  by optimizing it and make it more efficient.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> is related to the amount of memory occupied by the program. For example, if a program takes an array of size n as input, the space complexicity of the program becomes O(n).</p>
